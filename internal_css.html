		CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

	<h2>Dummy Data</h2>
	<p id="dummy_variable">
		A dummy variable is a numerical variable used in regression analysis to represent subgroups of the sample in your study. In research design, a dummy variable is often used to distinguish different treatment groups. In the simplest case, we would use a 0,1 dummy variable where a person is given a value of 0 if they are in the control group or a 1 if they are in the treated group. Dummy variables are useful because they enable us to use a single regression equation to represent multiple groups. This means that we don’t need to write out separate equation models for each subgroup. The dummy variables act like ‘switches’ that turn various parameters on and off in an equation. Another advantage of a 0,1 dummy-coded variable is that even though it is a nominal-level variable you can treat it statistically like an interval-level variable (if this made no sense to you, you probably should refresh your memory on levels of measurement). For instance, if you take an average of a 0,1 variable, the result is the proportion of 1s in the distribution.

	<h2>Other Data</h2>
	<p>
		With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

		Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
